Script with example 8.4 and function to create the impedance bus matrix of a power system from an networkx simple graph. This uses the four modification cases from Chapter 8 - "Power System Analysis" W. Stevenson et al.. The script also contains the function for Dr. Gabriel Kron's node reduction algorithm to generate an equivalent electric power network (Chapter 7 Stevenson's book).
